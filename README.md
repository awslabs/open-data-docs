# Open Data Documentation on AWS 

A repository of additional documentation for publicly available datasets that are listed on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws). Note that datasets in this registry are available via AWS resources, but they are not provided by AWS; these datasets are owned and maintained by a variety of government organizations, researchers, businesses, and individuals.

## What is this for?

When data is shared on AWS, anyone can analyze it and build services on top of it using a broad range of compute and data analytics products, including [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/). Sharing data in the cloud lets data users spend more time on data analysis rather than data acquisition. This repository exists to help people better understand datasets that are available via AWS resources.
