# NOAA National Water Model Reanalysis Model Data

In the field of Earth System Modeling, a reanalysis is a model
simulation that joins modern modeling technologies and newer, more
complete, datasets to obtain a better understanding of past
environments. For example, in weather forecasting, it can be thought of
as running a weather forecast model in the past. In such a scenario it
could mean the running of a weather model for a period when no data
existed in order to get a better understanding of the state of the
weather from that period. This same type of historical run can be
conducted for other types of models as well, including water models.

The National Water Model Reanalysis dataset contains output from a
A 25-year (January 1993 through December 2017) retrospective simulation using version 1.2 of the National Water Model, and a 26-year (January 1993 through December 2018) retrospective simulation using version 2.0 of the National Water Model (NWM). These simulations used
observed rainfall as input and ingested other required meteorological
input fields from a weather Reanalysis dataset. The output frequency and
fields available in this historical NWM dataset differ from those
contained in the real-time forecast model. One application of this
dataset is to provide historical context to current real-time
streamflow, soil moisture and snowpack NWM conditions. The Reanalysis
data can be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses
with hourly streamflow output and 3-hourly land surface output. The
long-term dataset can also be used in the development of end user
applications which require a long baseline of data for system training
or verification purposes.

## Accessing NWM Reanalysis on AWS


The NWM Reanalysis version 1.2 is stored in the **nwm-archive** Amazon S3
bucket while the version 2.0 is stored int he **noaa-nwm-retro-v2.0-pds** bucket both in the **us-east-1** AWS region.

This bucket contains the reanalysis archive organized by year starting
in 1993. The files are an internally compressed NetCDF format. They do
not need to be decompressed. Each file contains detailed metadata
describing the data stored within it.

You can use the AWS Command Line Interface to list a particular year
(2003 in this example) in the bucket like this:

`aws s3 ls s3://noaa-nwm-retro-v2.0-pds/full_physics/2003/ --no-sign-request`

`aws s3 ls nwm-archive/2003/ --no-sign-request`


or via a url constructed like this:
`https://noaa-nwm-retro-v2.0-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/?prefix=full_physics/2003`

`https://nwm-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/?prefix=2003`

Each year contains files for each hour of the year iterated over
different product types, not all products are published at hourly
intervals. The products types are listed in the table below.

  Product   Description                                                  Cycle            Example File Name
  --------- ------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------- ------------------------------------
  CHRTOUT   Streamflow values at points associated with flow lines       Every Hour       201701010000.CHRTOUT\_DOMAIN1.comp
  LAKEOUT   Output values at points associated with reservoirs (lakes)   Every Hour       201701010000.LAKEOUT\_DOMAIN1.comp
  LDASOUT   Land surface model output                                    Every 3rd Hour   201701010000.LDASOUT\_DOMAIN1.comp
  RTOUT     Ponded water and depth to soil saturation                    Every 3rd Hour   201701010000.RTOUT\_DOMAIN1.comp

Each product (data file) uses the following naming convention:
`yyyy/yyyymmddhhhh.product_DOMAIN1.comp` where:

-   `yyyy` year from 1993
-   `mm` month
-   `dd` day
-   `hhhh` hour of day
-   `product` (CHRTOUT, LAKEOUT, LDASOUT or RTOUT)
-   `DOMAIN1.comp` this is the same for all files

For example, to access the stream flow data for 12pm on May 1st 2003,
the key would be:

`2003/200305011200.CHRTOUT_DOMAIN1.comp`

To access the data, combine the key with the bucket name like this:

`s3://nwm-archive/2003/200305011200.CHRTOUT_DOMAIN1.comp`

or via HTTPS like this:

`https://nwm-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/2003/200305011200.CHRTOUT_DOMAIN1.com`

## Configuration of the Data

The dataset contains four products for each day. The four products are
listed below along with some of the parameters and properties of the
