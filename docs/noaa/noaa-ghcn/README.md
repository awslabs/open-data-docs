# NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCN-D)

GHCN-Daily is a dataset that contains daily observations over global
land areas. It contains station-based measurements from land-based
stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation
measurements only (Menne et al., 2012). GHCN-Daily is a composite of
climate records from numerous sources that were merged together and
subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews (Durre et al.,
2010). The archive includes the following meteorological elements:

-   Daily maximum temperature
-   Daily minimum temperature
-   Temperature at the time of observation
-   Precipitation (i.e., rain, melted snow)
-   Snowfall
-   Snow depth
-   Other elements where available

In this archive, the period of record station files are parsed into
yearly files that contain all available GHCN-Daily station data for that
year plus a time of observation field (where available—primarily for
U.S. Cooperative Observers). The observation times for U.S. Cooperative
Observer data come from the station history archived in NCDC’s
Historical Observing Metadata Repository (HOMR). The files are updated
daily on AWS to be in sync with updates to the GHCN-Daily dataset at
NOAA.

This document refers to two other files, ghcnd-stations.txt and
ghcnd-inventory.txt, which are also stored in the noaa-ghcn-pds S3
bucket. You can get these files here:

-   <http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/ghcnd-stations.txt>: The
    ghcnd-stations file contains summary information for over 160000
    stations used to create this dataset.
-   <http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/ghcnd-inventory.txt>: The
    ghcnd-inventory file contains the periods of record for each station
    and element.

## Accessing GHCN-D Data on AWS

The GHCH-D data are stored in the noaa-ghcn-pds bucket:

<http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/>

The directory is structured by year from 1763 to present, with each file
named after the respective year. The data are available in CSV file
format and as .csv.gzip files, so any particular year will be named
yyyy.csv and yyyy.csv.gz. For example to access the gziped version of
the data for 1788 append 1788.csv.gz to the bucket URL:

<http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/csv.gz/1788.csv.gz>

The uncompressed versions of the files can be accessed by using a
slightly different URL and a filename ending with CSV. For example to
access the uncompressed data for 1788 append 1788.csv to the bucket URL:

<http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/1788.csv>

If you use the AWS Command Line Interface, you can access the bucket
with this command:

`aws s3 ls noaa-ghcn-pds`

The data set is updated daily.

## Summary of the Day Format

The yearly files are formatted so that every observation is represented
by a single row with the following fields:

-   ID = 11 character station identification code. Please see
    ghcnd-stations section below for an explantation
-   YEAR/MONTH/DAY = 8 character date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g. 19860529
    = May 29, 1986)
-   ELEMENT = 4 character indicator of element type
-   DATA VALUE = 5 character data value for ELEMENT
-   M-FLAG = 1 character Measurement Flag
-   Q-FLAG = 1 character Quality Flag
-   S-FLAG = 1 character Source Flag
-   OBS-TIME = 4-character time of observation in hour-minute format
    (i.e. 0700 =7:00 am)

The fields are comma delimited and each row represents one station-day.

The table below describes the structure of each row of
ghcnd-stations.txt

| Variable     | Columns | Type      | Example     |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| ID           | 1-11    | Character | EI000003980 |
| LATITUDE     | 13-20   | Real      | 55.3717     |
| LONGITUDE    | 22-30   | Real      | -7.3400     |
| ELEVATION    | 32-37   | Real      | 21.0        |
| STATE        | 39-40   | Character |             |
| NAME         | 42-71   | Character | MALIN HEAD  |

| WMO ID       | 81-85   | Character | 03980       |

These variables have the following definitions:

-   ID = the station identification code.
    -   The first two characters denote the FIPS country code
    -   The third character is a network code that identifies the
        station numbering system used
    -   0 = unspecified (station identified by up to eight alphanumeric
        characters)
    -   1 = Community Collaborative Rain, Hail,and Snow (CoCoRaHS) based
        identification number. To ensure consistency with with GHCN
        Daily, all numbers in the original CoCoRaHS IDs have been
        left-filled to make them all four digits long. In addition, the
        characters “-” and “\_” have been removed to ensure that the IDs
        do not exceed 11 characters when preceded by “US1”. For example,
        the CoCoRaHS ID “AZ-MR-156” becomes “US1AZMR0156” in GHCN-Daily
    -   C = U.S. Cooperative Network identification number (last six
        characters of the GHCN-Daily ID)
    -   E = Identification number used in the ECA&D non-blended dataset
    -   M = World Meteorological Organization ID (last five characters
        of the GHCN-Daily ID)
    -   N = Identification number used in data supplied by a National
        Meteorological or Hydrological Center
    -   R = U.S. Interagency Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS)
        identifier
    -   S = U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack
        TELemtry (SNOTEL) station identifier
    -   W = WBAN identification number (last five characters of the
        GHCN-Daily ID)
    -   The remaining eight characters contain the actual station ID.

-   LATITUDE = latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

-   LONGITUDE = longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

-   STATE = U.S. postal code for the state (for U.S. and Canadian
    stations only).

-   NAME = name of the station.

-   GSN FLAG = flag that indicates whether the station is part of the
    GCOS Surface Network (GSN). The flag is assigned by
    cross-referencing the number in the WMOID field with the official
    list of GSN stations. There are two possible values:

    -   Blank = non-GSN station or WMO Station number not available
    -   GSN = GSN station

-   HCN/CRN FLAG = flag that indicates whether the station is part of
    the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN). There are three
    possible values:

    -   Blank = Not a member of the U.S. Historical Climatology or U.S.
        Climate Reference Networks
    -   HCN = U.S. Historical Climatology Network station
    -   CRN = U.S. Climate Reference Network or U.S. Regional Climate
        Network Station

-   WMO ID is the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) number for the
    station. If the station has no WMO number (or one has not yet been
    matched to this station), then the field is blank.

### Lookup Table of Country Codes

The table of the country is derived from the ghcnd-countries.txt file
available at the link below:

<http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/ghcnd-countries.txt>

The state codes are used in the station identification number. In the
table below CODE is the FIPS country code of the country where the
station is located.

### Look Up Table of State Codes

The table of the state codes below is a derived from the
ghcnd-states.txt file which is available at the link below

<http://noaa-ghcn-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/ghcnd-states.txt>

The state codes are used in the station identification number, the table
below CODE = is the POSTAL code of the U.S. state/territory or Canadian
province where the station is located.

| ELEMENT   | 32-35   | CHARACTER |
| FIRSTYEAR | 37-40   | INTEGER   |
| LASTYEAR  | 42-45   | INTEGER   |

-   ID = the station identification code. Please see
    “ghcnd-stations.txt” for a complete list of stations and their
    metadata.
-   LATITUDE = the latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
-   LONGITUDE = the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
-   ELEMENT = the element type. See section III for a definition of
    elements.
