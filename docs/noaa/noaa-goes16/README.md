# NOAA GOES on AWS

Data from NOAA's GOES-R series satellite is available on Amazon S3. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a constellation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) to provide continuous weather imagery and monitoring of meteorological and space environment data for the protection of life and property across the United States. GOES satellites provide critical atmospheric, oceanic, climatic and space weather products supporting weather forecasting and warnings, climatologic analysis and prediction, ecosystems management, safe and efficient public and private transportation, and other national priorities.

The satellites provide advanced imaging with increased spatial resolution, 16 spectral channels, and up to 1 minute scan frequency for more accurate forecasts and timely warnings.

The real-time feed and full historical archive of original resolution Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) radiance data (Level 1b) and full resolution Cloud and Moisture Imager (CMI) products (Level 2) are freely available on Amazon S3 for anyone to use.

## Accessing GOES Data on AWS

The availability of GOES-R Series on AWS data is the result of the NOAA Big Data Project (BDP) to explore the potential benefits of storing copies of key observations and model outputs in the Cloud to allow computing directly on the data without requiring further distribution. Such an approach could help form new lines of business and economic growth while making NOAA's data more easily accessible to the American public.

This page includes information on data structure; you can find much [more detailed information about GOES-R Series data from NOAA](http://www.goes-r.gov/).

Examples of how to access the objects via the AWS CLI can be seen below.

`aws s3 ls noaa-goes16 --no-sign-request`

`aws s3 ls noaa-goes17 --no-sign-request`

`aws s3 cp s3://noaa-goes16/<Product>/<Year>/<Day of Year>/<Hour>/<Filename> . --no-sign-request`

*Data will be moved to different Amazon S3 storage classes on a schedule. It will start in Standard and move to Infrequent Access after 30 days.*

## About the Data
All data files from GOES-16 (formerly GOES-R) & GOES-17 are provided in netCDF4 format. The GOES-16 data is hosted in the `noaa-goes16` Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. The GOES-17 data is hosted in the `noaa-goes17` Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. Individual files are availabe in the netCDF format with the following schema:

`<Product>/<Year>/<Day of Year>/<Hour>/<Filename>`
